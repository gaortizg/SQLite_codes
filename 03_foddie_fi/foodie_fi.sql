-- A. Customer Journey
-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample below from the
-- 'subscriptions' table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s
-- onboarding journey. Try to keep it as short as possible

-- Sample 'subscriptions' table
SELECT subscriptions.customer_id,
       subscriptions.plan_id,
       plans.plan_name,
       subscriptions.start_date
FROM subscriptions
JOIN plans
ON subscriptions.plan_id = plans.plan_id
WHERE subscriptions.customer_id IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19);

-- From the sample it can be seen that all of the customers start with
-- the 'Trial' period. All the customers use up the trial period, and
-- after 7 days, most of them convert their initial plan into a monthly
-- one (either basic or pro), which highlights the fact that these people
-- enjoy the content.
-- It can be seen that 2 clients (25% of the sample) decided to cancel
-- their subscription, while the remaining 75% of the customers have either
-- upgraded to a monthly or annual plan. Most of the customers who upgraded
-- their plans started with a monthly subscription, and later on (2-3
-- months after initial upgrade), decided to upgrade again to a higher
-- subscription level

-- B. Data analysis questions
-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
